# TyrantBuildTools
No these are not tools for building stuff inside the game (with blocks).

This mod provides tools to help with mod development (in-game only). <br/>
- Reload N Rejoin (/rnr), an in-game commmand that exits the game (optionally without saving), recompiles the mod (specified in config) and rejoins the same world with the same character.

- Packaging options to disable TML's image compression and an option to use fast compression for files. These may increase packaging times.
